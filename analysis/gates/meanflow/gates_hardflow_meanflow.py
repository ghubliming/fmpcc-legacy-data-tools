"""Gen3v6 U3 pre-flight gates for the HardFlow arm ported into Gen3v6 (MeanFlow).

The HardFlow math is a VERBATIM copy of Gen12 (see the U3 changelog), so Gen12's own gates
(`FM_v3_hardflow_test/gates_hardflow.py`: dof layout, time direction, NLP feasibility) still
cover it. The ONE thing that is new in Gen3v6 — and the only thing that can silently break the
math — is that the velocity is now queried from a MEAN-FLOW net at h=0, using the identity
`u(x,t,0) = v(x,t)` (mf_diffusion.py:443-461). These gates pin exactly that.

Run on the cluster (needs torch; casadi NOT needed for H0/H1):

    python FM_v3_meanflow_test/gates_hardflow_meanflow.py
    python FM_v3_meanflow_test/gates_hardflow_meanflow.py --checkpoint <loadpath>   # adds H2
