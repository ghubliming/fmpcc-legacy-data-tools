# FM v3 ODE-Selectable Data Analysis Tool

Comprehensive evaluation analysis script for Flow Matching v3 ODE-Selectable model across multiple projection variants, constraint types, and random seeds.

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Analyze results from a specific directory
python main_da.py --input-path /path/to/eval/results

# With custom output location
python main_da.py --input-path /path/to/eval/results --output-path ./my_analysis

# Only analyze specific variants
python main_da.py --input-path /path/to/eval/results --variants dpcc-c,dpcc-r,dpcc-t,diffuser

# Only analyze specific seeds
python main_da.py --input-path /path/to/eval/results --seeds 6,7,8,9

# Skip expensive plot generation
python main_da.py --input-path /path/to/eval/results --no-plots

# Verbose output
python main_da.py --input-path /path/to/eval/results --verbose
```

### Example: FM-PCC Workspace

```bash
cd /workspaces/FM-PCC

# Analyze FM_v3_ode_selectable_test results
python Data_Analysis/DA_Code/main_da.py \
    --input-path FM_v3_ode_selectable_test \
    --output-path ./analysis_output

# Quick analysis (no plots)
python Data_Analysis/DA_Code/main_da.py \
    --input-path FM_v3_ode_selectable_test \
    --no-plots
```

## Output Structure

The script creates a timestamped output directory with the following structure:

### `Latest_Snapshot` — when was this run produced?

Batch mode (`main_da_batch.py`) records, per candidate, the config-snapshot
markers the eval pipeline leaves behind: every launch writes
`snapshot_<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>` into `<candidate>/<seed>/config_snapshot_<config>/`
and never deletes the earlier ones (`utils/setup.py::snapshot_configs`).

| file | grain |
|---|---|
| `candidates_multidimensional_raw.csv` | that **seed's** newest marker (blank when that seed has none) |
| `candidates_multidimensional_aggregated.csv`, `candidates_ranking.csv` | newest marker over all the candidate's seeds |
| `candidates_detailed.csv` | plus `First_Snapshot`, `Snapshot_Count`, `Snapshot_By_Seed` |
| `candidates_summary.txt` | human-readable, with a per-seed line when the seeds disagree |

`Visualizer/index.html` renders it as a **Last Run** column in the Path Audit Map
and the Plot Legend, and repeats it in the exported audit `.txt` / LaTeX. Older
batches have no such column and the page drops it instead of showing blanks.

## Variant quick presets (viewer only)

Three checkboxes above `5. Variants` tick a whole comparison at once. They are a
shortcut for the boxes below them, not a second filter — what is plotted is
always exactly what the main list shows.

| preset | ticks |
|---|---|
| **DPCC + HF** | `diffuser` + every `dpcc-{r,c,t}` and `hardflow_new*` arm, tightened or not |
| **DPCC + HF (tightened)** | `diffuser` + only the `-tightened` `dpcc-{r,c,t}` / `hardflow_new-{r,c,t}` arms |
| **DPCC (tightened)** | `diffuser` + only the `-tightened` `dpcc-{r,c,t}` arms |

`diffuser` is in all three: it is the unconstrained generator the projection arms
are read against, and it has no tightened twin. Deliberately excluded everywhere:
the `dpcc-c-tightened-dt*` timestep sweep (a sweep, not an arm — four
near-identical bars beside the one that matters) and the non-projection baselines
`gradient` / `post_processing` / `model_free` / `geo_free` / `bounds_free`.

Membership is a rule over the variant name, so a batch that gains an arm gets it
for free and a preset with no members in this batch is not rendered at all. A
preset box shows the grey indeterminate mark when only some of its variants are
selected.

## Plot Legend: highlight + seed coverage (viewer only)

The **Plot Legend — Selected Candidates** table under the chart carries two
columns that exist only in the page, not in any CSV:

- **HL** — a checkbox. Ticking it paints that candidate's *name* red wherever it
  is printed: the plot's x tick label, the legend row, every row head in the
  Result Matrices, and the Path Audit Map. Nothing else changes — no number, no
  cell background — so a highlight can never be mistaken for a data annotation
  the way the `(goal, constraint)` flags can. Purely a way to follow one row
  across ~18 variant columns. `[CLEAR HIGHLIGHTS]` in the legend header resets
  them all, including candidates you have since unticked in the sidebar. The
  exported `.txt` and `.tex` have no colour, so they say `[HIGHLIGHTED]` /
  `<-- highlighted in the viewer` in words instead.
- **Seeds** — which seeds that candidate actually has, from
  `candidates_multidimensional_raw.csv`, with a red **⚠ NOT FULL** naming the
  ones it is missing (against the batch's full seed set, or against the ticked
  seeds in Custom Seed Compare). A bar averaged over one seed and a bar averaged
  over five are identical on the chart; this is the only place next to the plot
  that says which you are looking at. With no raw CSV the page falls back to the
  `Missing_Seeds` column and says `n/a` for the present-seed list rather than
  claiming the candidate has none.

## Plot: `(G, C)` failure hints (viewer only)

Every bar carries its value above it. A red **`(G, C)`** stacked above that value
marks a bar whose run was not clean — the same rule as the Result Matrices'
trailing `(goal, constraint)` flag:

* `(G)` — goal not always reached (`n_success < 1`)
* `(C)` — a constraint was violated (`n_success_and_constraints < n_success`)
* nothing — a fully successful run

Read it as: *an unflagged 199 steps and a flagged 199 steps are not comparable
numbers.* The note under the x-axis spells the marks out and counts them.

The flag is skipped on `n_success` and `n_success_and_constraints` themselves,
where it would only restate the bar's own height. It is computed on the plot's
**own** x-axis grouping, so it stays correct in `By Environment` mode where the
selected candidates are averaged into each bar.

### Variant colours

Every variant gets its **own** colour, and the page verifies that on each draw.
(It used to pass `colormap='tab10'`, which holds ten colours — with more than ten
variants selected, several were sampled onto the same entry and two methods drew
identically.) Colours are keyed to the variant's position in the batch's full
variant list, so a variant keeps its colour as you tick others on and off, and
two screenshots of the same batch stay comparable.

## Key Metrics

The tool analyzes:

- **n_success**: Goal reached success rate (%)
- **n_success_and_constraints**: Goal + constraint satisfaction (%)
- **collision_free_completed**: Collision-free rate (%)
- **n_steps**: Planning steps (mean ± std)
- **avg_time**: Computation time (ms)
- **n_violations**: Constraint violations per trial
- **total_violations**: Cumulative violation magnitude

## Key Plots

   - Shows accuracy vs. time tradeoff
   - Color-coded: dpcc-c/r/t (red/orange/yellow), Baseline (blue)
   - Clearly shows which method is best overall

2. **01_variants_n_success_and_constraints.png**
   - Bar chart ranking all variants by goal + constraint success
   - Shows top performers and baselines

3. **results_summary.txt**
   - Human-readable ranking table
   - Top 10 variants by different metrics
   - Performance breakdowns by constraint type

## Architecture

### Modules

- **main_da.py**: Entry point with CLI interface
- **config.py**: Default parameters and plot styling
- **data_loader.py**: Loads .npz result files from directory tree
- **aggregator.py**: Aggregates results across seeds, computes statistics
- **visualizer.py**: Creates publication-quality plots
- **reporter.py**: Generates summary reports (txt and csv)
- **utils.py**: Logging, file operations, helpers

### Data Flow

```
Input .npz files (eval results)
         ↓
    DataLoader (organize by seed/variant/constraint)
         ↓
    DataAggregator (compute mean/std across seeds)
         ↓
    ┌────┴─────┬─────────┬─────────┐
    ↓          ↓         ↓         ↓
 Reporter  Visualizer Summary   Histogram
(txt/csv)  (plots)    (txt)      (csv)
```

## Requirements

```
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
pyyaml (optional, for config parsing)
scipy (optional, for statistical tests in future)
```

Install with:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib pyyaml
```

## Configuration

default parameters in `config.py`:
- Seeds: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
- Variants: 18 projection methods (dpcc-c/r/t and others)
- Constraint types: halfspace, obstacles, dynamics, bounds
- Halfspace variants: top-right-hard, top-left-hard, both-hard

Modify `config.py` to change defaults, or use CLI flags to override.

## Tips

1. **First run**: Use `--no-plots` to quickly check data is loading correctly
2. **Quick analysis**: Analyze only main variants with `--variants dpcc-c,dpcc-r,dpcc-t,diffuser`
3. **Thesis prep**: Focus on `00_pareto_frontier_accuracy_vs_time.png` and `results_summary.txt`
4. **Debugging**: Check `logs/data_loading.log` if files aren't found

## Performance

- **Data Loading**: ~10-30 seconds (depends on SSD speed)
- **Aggregation**: ~2-5 seconds
- **Visualization**: ~30-60 seconds (10+ plots)
- **Total**: ~1-2 minutes for full analysis
